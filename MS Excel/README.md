**‚öì Marine Insurance Claims Pricing and Risk Assessment**

This project involves analysing Marine Liability insurance claims and applying actuarial pricing techniques using **Excel**. A dataset of **100 claims** was used to identify patterns, assess risks and calculate premiums through experience-based rating methods.

**üîç Problem Statement**

Marine Liability insurance exposes insurers to high-cost, low-frequency risks. To ensure accurate pricing, actuaries must analyse claims experience, detect anomalies and adjust premium rates accordingly. This project focuses on:

*   Analysing Marine Liability claims data.
*   Applying actuarial pricing methods (experience-based rating).
*   Extracting actionable insights for premium adjustments and risk management.

**üß™ Key Features**

*   **Dataset Analysis**: Reviewed 100 Marine Liability insurance claims.
*   **Experience-Based Rating**: Calculated premiums using historical loss experience.
*   **Risk Assessment**: Evaluated claim variability, loss ratios and portfolio adequacy.
*   **Visualization**: Developed charts and tables to summarise claims distribution.
*   **Documentation**: Report sheet prepared with assumptions, methodologies and commentary.

**üìä Tools and Techniques**

*   **Excel**: Pivot tables, formulas, charts for analysis.
*   **Statistical Methods**: Frequency, severity and loss ratio analysis.
*   **Actuarial Pricing**: Applied experience-based rating to evaluate premium sufficiency.

**üîé Key Insights**

*   **Claim Distribution**: The majority of claims fell within the mid-range, but a small number of high-value claims heavily influenced results.
*   **Loss Ratio**: Overall portfolio loss ratio suggested moderate under-pricing, with some claim groups exceeding expected thresholds.
*   **Frequency vs Severity**: While frequency was relatively stable, severity showed significant volatility, driving premium inadequacy.
*   **Premium Adjustment**: Experience rating indicated the need for upward premium revision to reflect true risk exposure.
*   **Risk Drivers**: Certain categories (by claim type/region) displayed higher average severities, signalling concentration risks.
